# About Me
* Why did I join GitHub?

I joined GitHub because I am a python module creator and I want to upload my modules online, because in other way no one will use it and it will mean that I made this module for nothing.

* Are you new in GitHub?

Actually, no, because I joined GitHub on my past account: EekusGD, and I lost this account because of 2FA. And I fcking (I'm sorry) HATE 2FA, I DON'T NEED AUTOMATIC BUT WEAK ACCOUNT SECURITY, I DON'T NEED 2 STEP VERIFICATIONS, REMOVE THIS SH*T, I'm SICK OF IT-

aight stop. Forgive me, I just got angry for some seconds, and 2FA, kiss my @ss, my script's broken because of you.

Getting back to questions, let's go! ahhh... 2fa, get off my headüò≠

* Is your modules hard?

Nah, I create easy modules, I am just a lazy man sitting and coding python around and getting errors around, so I f*ck creating hard python modules to 'em, I kinda suck.

Like look at my best module - pyadv that takes something like 200+ lines, and look at the motherf*cking telebot, the line count of this module is giving nightmares to me.

* Do you have another "job"?

Why did I said job in quotation marks? Because I am just an advanced python programmer, I am still teaching python! So yes I have another "job". It is Rapping, but I usually rap alone and don't upload my raps anywhere and I also can freestyle but with not this much meaning.

* Are you English?

No, I am Russian, and don't hate me. –í–æ—Ç –º–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–µ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —á—Ç–æ —è –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º (Here's a small proof that I talk Russian). I knew english when I was still in kindergarten, like not very, but good.

* Are you good at math?

Nah I suck, my math grades is like D or C (In Russia, we grade people using numbers, not letters. And I wanted to say that my math grades is like 3 or 4 usually.).

* So if you're bad at math, are you good at English?

Have you read it carefully? Yes, As I said, "I knew english when I was still in kindergarten (in line 26, line 4)", So it means I am good at english.
